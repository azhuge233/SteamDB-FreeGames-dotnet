## Build

### Publish

```
dotnet publish -c Release -o /your/path/here -r [win10-x64/osx-x64/linux-x64]
```

~~publish as a single file~~

~~```~~
dotnet publish -c Release -o /your/path/here -r [win10-x64/osx-x64/linux-x64] -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
~~```~~

~~and enable compression if you want to~~

~~```~~
dotnet publish -c Release -o /your/path/here -r [win10-x64/osx-x64/linux-x64] -p:PublishTrimmed=true
~~```~~

 Currently, publishing as a single file will make playwright dysfunctional.
