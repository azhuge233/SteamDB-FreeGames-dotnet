## Usage

Before executing the binary file, please follow these steps:

1. Create a config.json file and a record.json file in the same directory.

2. Add these variables in config.json file

   ```json
   {
   	"TOKEN": "",
   	"CHAT_ID": "",
   	"API_KEY": ""
   }
   ```

   Then fill your Telegram Bot token, your account's Chat ID and your 2captcha API key.

3. Add a "[]"(empty bracket, as a empty list in json format) in record.json file, otherwise the program will throw a null object error.

Tested on Windows Server 2016, macOS Catalina 10.15.6.
